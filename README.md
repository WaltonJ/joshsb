My extension for Small Basic - it includes several functions, some I use on a regular basis and some completely new.

======

Files - unless I rename them, these links should stay the same

IntelliSense XML file - you'll need this for IntelliSense to work and show you examples, syntax etc.

The actual extension itself - DLL file
https://github.com/WaltonJ/joshsb/blob/master/joshsb/joshsb/joshsb.dll

The source - Class1.cs
https://github.com/WaltonJ/joshsb/blob/master/joshsb/joshsb/Class1.cs

How to install

1) Download Joshs Small Basic Extension.dll and Joshs Small Basic Extension.XML from above

2) Navigate to your Small Basic install directory:
   32 bit? This should be C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Small Basic
   64 bit? This should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Small Basic\

3) If there is not already a folder in this directory named lib (case-sensitive), make one now.

4) Move the DLL and XML file to the lib directory. Do not move the Small Basic Library DLL.
